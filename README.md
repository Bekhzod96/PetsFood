# Newsweek responsive page

> This is a Pet shopping website wich its design is based in the Mohammed Awad design that you can find in the webpage Behance in this link [Design Mohammed Awad](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX), the main idea is to use CSS properties and features like Flexbox, Grid and others. Also I used the framework bootstrap and the preprocessor Sass in order to make faster the workflow.
